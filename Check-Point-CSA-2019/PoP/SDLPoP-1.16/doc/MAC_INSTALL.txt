This is how I got things to compile.  There are other ways.


GET SDL AND SDL_IMAGE:
	a) Install "port" from http://www.macports.org/
	b) Using port, install sdl & sdl_image.

GET DEVLEOPMENT TOOLS:
	a) Install Xcode.
	b) Install the "command line developer tools" by typing 'xcode-select --install' at the prompt.
	c) Using terminal, in the root directory of SDLPOP, type "make".

PLAY!
	a) Type './prince' or './prince full'.
	b) Hit Control-Q to quit.

DISCLAIMER:  I am using OSX 10.9.5 with Xcode 6.0.1, libsdl 1.2.15_3+x11, libsdl_image 1.2.12_4, and SDLPOP v1.09.  I don't know what will happen if you don't have my exact setup.

I don't know what I have broken in my amature attempt to get SDLPOP to compile and run.
